## Features

### Character Creation Wizard
A guided 10-step wizard walks you through the full TOR2E character creation process:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Welcome & overview |
| 2 | Choose Heroic Culture |
| 3 | Choose Calling & Favoured Skills |
| 4 | Assign Attributes (Strength / Heart / Wits) |
| 5 | Allocate Skill & Combat Proficiency pips |
| 6 | Choose Virtues |
| 7 | Select Distinctive Features |
| 8 | Equip your hero (weapons, armour, helm, shield) |
| 9 | Write your backstory & identity |
| 10 | Review character sheet & export |

**Heroic Cultures:** Bardings of Dale · Dwarves of Durin's Folk · Elves of Lindon · Hobbits of the Shire · Men of Bree · Rangers of the North

**Callings:** Captain · Champion · Messenger · Scholar · Treasure Hunter · Warden

**Attribute Sets:** Each culture offers multiple fixed-value sets (e.g. 5/4/3) plus a free-assign **7/6/5** option where you distribute the values yourself across Strength, Heart, and Wits.

### Character Sheet
The final step renders a full formatted character sheet with:
- Derived stats (Endurance, Hope, Parry, Wound Threshold, Weary Threshold)
- Skill pip display with favoured skill indicators (★)
- Combat Proficiencies
- Cultural Blessing, Virtues, and Distinctive Features
- Equipment summary with ratings and load (Dwarves of Durin's Folk automatically apply the **Redoubtable** blessing: armour and helm load are halved, rounded up)
- Backstory

### Play Mode
A **▶ Play** button sits permanently in the top bar (disabled until step 9 is complete). Clicking it jumps to the character sheet and enters Play mode — the step indicator and bottom navigation bar are hidden to prevent accidental edits during a session. The button turns green and changes to **⏸ Pause**; clicking it exits Play mode and re-enables all navigation. Play mode is session-only and resets on reload.

In Play mode the following are hidden to keep the view focused on the session:
- **Print / Save as PDF**, **Download HTML**, **Save as JSON**, and **Copy Share URL** export buttons
- The step indicator and bottom wizard navigation

**Save to Roster** and **View Roster →** remain visible in Play mode. The **Hope Current** field in the Hope panel is greyed out and disabled — it mirrors the value from the In-Play Tracking grid, which remains the single point of entry for that value.

### In-Play Tracking
The character sheet has interactive fields for tracking session state:

**Hope / Shadow panel** (mid-sheet):
- **Hope Current** — mirrors `Current Hope` from the tracking grid below; the two fields share a single value. Editable in Pause mode, read-only (greyed) in Play mode. · **Shadow Total** · **Shadow Permanent**

**In-Play Tracking section** (bottom of sheet):
All 6 fields display a `/ max` suffix for quick reference:
- **Current Endurance** `/ {derived max}` · **Current Hope** `/ {derived max}` · **Current Shadow** `/ {miserable threshold}`
- **Fellowship Points** `/ —` · **Adventure Points** `/ —` · **Treasure Points** `/ —`

All values auto-save to the roster whenever a character has been saved there — no button needed.

### Character Roster
A secondary page (accessible from the welcome screen or the review page) stores all your saved characters in browser localStorage. From the roster you can:
- Browse all saved characters with culture, calling, and last-saved date
- See an **In Progress** badge on characters who haven't reached the review step
- **Load** a character back into the wizard
- **Delete** a character

### Export Options
From the character sheet you can:
- **Print / Save as PDF** via the browser print dialog
- **Download HTML** — a fully self-contained file with all styles, fonts, and colours embedded; opens correctly in any browser without an internet connection
- **Save as JSON** — the full character object for backup or import
- **Copy Share URL** — a compressed URL that encodes the character; anyone with the link can view the sheet
- **Save to Roster** — persists the character to browser localStorage

|-------|-----------|
| Framework | React 19 + Vite 7 |
| Styling | CSS Modules with custom properties |
